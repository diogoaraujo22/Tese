\section*{Motivation}

With the advent and increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is of utmost importance to have strong behaviour guarantees of the blockchain software they rely upon.

Ensuring correct behavior can be brought by using formal methods (FM) and,
indeed, there is a series of workshops devoted to formal methods applied
to blockchain software.\footnote{\label{fn:221012a} Namely: \href{https://sites.google.com/view/fmbc}{FMBC'19}, \href{https://fmbc.gitlab.io/2020}{FMBC'20}, \href{https://fmbc.gitlab.io/2021}{FMBC'21} and \href{https://fmbc.gitlab.io/2022}{FMBC'22}.} Particular techniques such as theorem proving and
formal semantics have been successfully applied to blockchain.

However, there seems
to be no reported experience in using calculational proofs, namely the algebra
of programming \cite{BM97,Ol05}. The main aim of this project is to challenge such algebraic methods
in the blockchain domain and to see how they compare to the other formal approaches.

\section*{Goals}

Blockchains are decentralized transactional ledgers that rely on cryptographic hash functions for guaranteeing the integrity of stored data. Agreement on what valid transactions are is achieved through consensus algorithms. Blockchains also support so-called smart contracts that are stored in the blockchain and run on the network by interacting with the ledger’s data and updating its state. 

The first workshop on formal methods for blockchain took place in October 2019, as part of the 3rd World Congress in Formal Methods (FM'19). This inaugurated a series of events which aim at ensuring safety and quality in blockchain technologies by use of formal methods techniques. (See footnote \ref{fn:221012a}.) These have included theorem proving and formsl semantics definition but not calculational proofs advocated by the algebra of programming. On the oher hand, very simple exercises carried out in lab assignments in the Algebra of Programming course at U. Minho have shown that blockchain components such as e.g.\ Merkle trees can be tackled rather easily and effectively in that way.

The main aim of this dissertation is to start from such exercises and,
by inspecting hackage libraries such as \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskoin-core}{haskoin} and \href{https://hackage.haskell.org/package/blockchain}{blockchain}, trying to identify generic patterns that arise in such libraries and can be identified as \emph{certified components} of blockchain software.

This work can be framed in the broad discipline of formal methods applied to
software design, stepping up the paradigm of deriving correct-by-construction
programs from logic specifications.

\section*{Research plan}

The theoretical background of the proposed work requires familiarity with
\cite{BM97,Ol05}, whose study in depth is part of
the overall research plan, structured in four main steps:

\begin{description}

\item[Background and state of the art] -- The first months will be devoted
to the study of the state of the art and technical background related to
the project, including previous work in the same application domain.

\item[Writing the PDR report] -- The outcome of the previous step will be
embodied in the pre-dissertation report (PDR) that will delimit and characterise
the problem to be addressed in the future master’s dissertation.

\item[Contribution] -- Main body of research evolving towards the main aim
of the project: analysis and reverse specification of blockchain software,
trying to identify generic patterns that arise in such libraries and can be
identified as delivered as \emph{certified components} of blockchain software.

\item[Writing up] - Incorporating all final results and suggestions for future
work in the master's dissertation.
\end{description}

%------------------------------------------------

\section*{Deliverables}

This project is expected to deliver, besides the PDR report and the dissertation itself:
\begin{itemize}
\item   a presentation of the work in the InfoBlender talk series of HASLab;
\item   a conference paper.
\end{itemize}
