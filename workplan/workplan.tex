\section*{Motivation}

With the advent and increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is of utmost importance to have strong behaviour guarantees of the blockchain software whereupon they rely.

Blockchains are decentralized transactional ledgers that rely on cryptographic hash functions for guaranteeing the integrity of the stored data. Agreement on what valid transactions are is achieved through consensus algorithms. Blockchains may also provide support for smart contracts that are stored in the blockchain and run on the network by interacting with the ledger’s data and updating its state. 

Ensuring correct behavior can be brought by using formal methods (FM) and, indeed, there is a series of workshops devoted to formal methods applied to blockchain software. Particular techniques such as theorem proving and formal semantics have been successfully applied to blockchain but there seems to be no reported experience in using calculational methods, e.g. the algebra of programming. The main aim of this work will be to challenge such methods in the blockchain domain.

\section*{Goals}

The first workshop on formal methods for blockchain took place in October 2019, as part of the 3rd World Congress in Formal Methods (FM'19). This inaugurated a series of events which aim at ensuring safety and quality in blockchain technologies by use of formal methods.

Blockchains are decentralized transactional ledgers that rely on cryptographic hash functions for guaranteeing the integrity of the stored data. Participants on the network reach agreement on what valid transactions are through consensus algorithms.

Blockchains may also provide support for Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are scripts of an ad-hoc programming language that are stored in the blockchain and that run on the network. They can interact with the ledger’s data and update its state. These scripts can express the logic of possibly complex contracts between users of the blockchain. Thus, Smart Contracts can facilitate the economic activity of blockchain participants.

With the emergence and increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is now of utmost importance to have strong guarantees of the behaviour of blockchain so ware. These guarantees can be brought by using Formal Methods. Indeed, Blockchain software encompasses many topics of computer science where using Formal Methods techniques and tools is relevant: consensus algorithms to ensure the liveness and the security of the data on the chain, programming languages specifically designed to write smart contracts, cryptographic protocols, such as zero-knowledge proofs, used to ensure privacy, etc.

The main aim of this dissertation is to start from ........



This work can be framed in the broad discipline of formal methods applied to
software design, stepping up the paradigm of deriving correct-by-construction
programs from logic specifications.

\section*{Research plan}

The theoretical background of the proposed work requires familiarity with
\cite{BM97,Ba04a,Ol20}, whose study in depth is part of
the overall research plan, structured in four main steps:

\begin{description}

\item[Background and state of the art] -- The first months will be devoted
to the study of the state of the art and technical background related to
the project, including previous work in the same application domain \cite{SO08}.

\item[Writing the PDR report] -- The outcome of the previous step will be
embodied in the pre-dissertation report (PDR) that will delimit and characterise
the problem to be addressed in the future master’s dissertation.

\item[Contribution] -- Main body of research evolving towards the main aim of the
project: the design of a software development strategy from specifications 
that follow the GC pattern, leading to correct-by-construction
artifacts, with possible automation using the Galculator tool --- which will need to
be refactored from its legacy state \cite{SO08}.

\item[Writing up] - Incorporating all final results and suggestions for future
work in the master's dissertation.
\end{description}

%------------------------------------------------

\section*{Deliverables}

This project is expected to deliver, besides the PDR report and the dissertation itself:
\begin{itemize}
\item   an InfoBlender talk;
\item   a conference paper.
\end{itemize}
